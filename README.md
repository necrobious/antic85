antic85 
-------
RFC1924 Is an IETF April 1 joke RFC for representing IPv6 address using a Base85 encoding with a custom variant.
The RFC1924 variant alphabet uses characters that work well as JSON strings without the need for character escaping.

Antic85 is an encode/decode library that exposes the chunk encoder with an encode/decode interface similar to the base64 interface
